1. All tests should have:
    Init
    Execution
    Validation
2. Don't relay on test coverage - comment out example when coverage is 100%. The most important is that test should have init, execution and VALIDATION
3. Uint or intergation depends on inplementing code - all test in Go use *testing.T
4. Integration test in our case is when we are calling the functions from different package
