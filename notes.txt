1. All tests should have:
    Init
    Execution
    Validation
2. Don't relay on test coverage - comment out example when coverage is 100%. The most important is that test should have init, execution and VALIDATION
// BubleSort function - proof that coverage is not a good metric
func TestBubleSortAlready(t *testing.T) {
	// Init
	elements := []int{9,7,5,3}

	//Execution
	BubleSort(elements)
}

3. Uint or intergation depends on inplementing code - all test in Go use *testing.T
4. Integration test in our case is when we are calling the functions from different package
